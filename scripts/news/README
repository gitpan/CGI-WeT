These scripts can be used to implement a news section (or editorials,
reviews, columns).  The files they create can be used with the engine
extensions in CGI::WeT::Modules::News.  I have the scripts in the root news
directory.

contribute.form.cgi will accept HTML.  I am wanting to create a Smart
Text version similar to HyperNews.  If the user is authenticated,
the script will not ask for name and email.  Instead, it will use
CGI::WeT::User to extract that information from the user database.
(This distribution only provides a semi-working class for LDAP.)

index.cgi will provide an index of articles in any particular channel
(general being the default).  This can be set with something like
/news/index.cgi?channel=mychannel as the URL.  The same holds
(I believe) with the contribute.form.cgi script.
