The chooser.cgi script will send back a cookie to the browser with the
theme set.  This is used in conjunction with the THEME_CHOOSER engine
extension to allow browsers to choose their theme.

The news/ scripts can be used in conjunction with the News engine
extensions (CGI::WeT::Modules::News) to provide for rudimentary news
management.  Unauthenticated stories are placed in a holding bin
(@@NEWS@@/todo/<channel>/).  Otherwise, they are placed in the on-line
location (@@NEWS@@/<channel>/) for immediate viewing.  @@NEWS@@ is the
directory where the news files are located (see CGI::WeT::Modules::News
for more information).

The apache/ directory contains some files to illustrate getting Apache up and
running with CGI::WeT.
