ABOUT
-----
CGI::WeT is a package to help build a website with the ability to offer
looks for the same content.  CGI::WeT prefers Apache with mod_perl but can
be made to work without mod_perl with a little more effort.

Version 0.70 is primarily a bug-fix and beta code release.

-------
INSTALL
-------

To install CGI::WeT run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

This should install all the man pages and perl modules.

Available man pages are
     CGI::WeT
     CGI::WeT::Engine
     CGI::WeT::Theme
     CGI::WeT::Modules::Basic
     CGI::WeT::Modules::News
     CGI::WeT::User
     CGI::WeT::User::DBI::LDAP

The `scripts' directory has some sample scripts that should work with mod_perl.
The `themes' directory has a sample theme to illustrate how themes are created.

-------
ROADMAP
-------

Where is CGI::WeT going?  

Beginning code is in place to allow CGI::WeT to take the place of the CGI 
module in cgi scripts.  Work will continue through the next several 0.7x 
releases.

Additional theme definition formats will be coming.  Formost is the use of
HTML to define themes.  Possible look at HTML::Template for some pointers.
This might be waiting for Perl 5.6 with its regexp extensions...
