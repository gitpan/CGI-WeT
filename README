CGI::WeT is a package to help build a website with the ability to offer
looks for the same content.  CGI::WeT prefers Apache with mod_perl but can
be made to work without mod_perl with a little more effort.

To install CGI::WeT run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

This should install all the man pages and perl modules.

Available man pages are
     CGI::WeT
     CGI::WeT::Engine
     CGI::WeT::Theme
     CGI::WeT::Modules::Basic
     CGI::WeT::Modules::News
     CGI::WeT::User
     CGI::WeT::User::DBI::LDAP

The `scripts' directory has some sample scripts that should work with mod_perl.
The `themes' directory has a sample theme to illustrate how themes are created.
