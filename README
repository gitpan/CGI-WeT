                                 CGI::WeT 0.71
                                 -------------

CGI::WeT is a package to help build a website with the ability to offer
looks for the same content.  CGI::WeT prefers Apache with mod_perl but can
be made to work without mod_perl with a little more effort.

Version 0.71 provides almost complete emulation of CGI.pm.  Any differences
from normal operation after converting a script from CGI to CGI::WeT
should be considered bugs in CGI::WeT (unless they aren't).  Please
report them to the mailing list.

To install, simply type

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make install

This should install all the man pages and perl modules.

The `scripts' directory has some sample scripts that should work with mod_perl.
The `themes' directory has a sample theme to illustrate how themes are created.

ROADMAP
-------

Where is CGI::WeT going?  

Additional theme definition formats will be coming.  Formost is the use of
HTML to define themes.  Possible look at HTML::Template for some pointers.
This might be waiting for Perl 5.6 with its regexp extensions...

The code will be focusing more on presenting the page and less on building
a complete site.  Other modules do well providing news services and
database presentation.  CGI::WeT will focus on building the page.
